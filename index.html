                “Being a woman in a team of all men means that you are going to have a unique voice. It’s important to
                embrace that.”<br>
                <br>
                The IEEE WIE BITS Pilani Student chapter functions with the belief of encouraging and emerging the
                contribution of women in the world of technology. It gives female students a community of peers and a
                connection to faculty and industry professionals who drive innovation in countless technical fields.
                Student involvement in Branch activities, whether special projects, social and technical meetings,
                outreach programs, conferences, local Section or Regional opportunities, etc. can help develop a record
                of accomplishment and capabilities beyond the norm.

                To encourage female participation, a hackathon named “Pink Hackathon” was conducted by the IEEE
                student’s chapter. It was an opportunity for girls to find a feasible solution for daily life problems
                in BITS Pilani that the participants wanted to take up and solve. The solutions could involve
                technologies like Cryptography, App Development, Blockchain, Machine Learning, Web Development,
                Electronics, etc. This event was successful and it witnessed huge participation with creative solutions.
